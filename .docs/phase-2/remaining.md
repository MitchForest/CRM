# Phase 2 - Remaining Issues

## Critical Issues to Resolve

### 1. Backend Connection Refused
**Issue**: Frontend cannot connect to backend API
```
:8080/Api/V8/module/Cases?page[number]=1&page[size]=20:1  Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
:8080/Api/V8/module/Cases?page[size]=100&filter[priority][eq]=High:1  Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
```

**Investigation Needed**:
- [ ] Check if backend server is running
- [ ] Verify correct port configuration (8080)
- [ ] Check docker-compose setup
- [ ] Verify API endpoint configuration

### 2. Cases Page Shows Blank
**Issue**: Navigating to `/cases` shows a blank page with console errors

**Investigation Needed**:
- [ ] Check Cases route configuration in App.tsx
- [ ] Verify CasesList component is properly exported/imported
- [ ] Check for any JavaScript errors preventing render
- [ ] Verify API connection for cases module

### 3. No Data Displaying in Any Module
**Issue**: All modules (Leads, Contacts, Accounts, Opportunities, Activities, Cases) show no data

**Possible Causes**:
1. **No seed data in database**
   - Need to check for database seeders
   - May need to create seeders for all modules
   
2. **Authentication/Authorization issues**
   - Token might be expired or invalid
   - API might be rejecting requests
   
3. **Database connection issues**
   - Backend might not be connected to database
   - Database might not be running

**Investigation Needed**:
- [ ] Check for existing database seeders in backend
- [ ] Look for seed data scripts or commands
- [ ] Verify authentication is working
- [ ] Check database connection status
- [ ] Review backend logs for errors

## Root Cause Identified

**The Docker services are not running!** This is why:
- API calls are failing with ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
- No data is showing in any module
- Cases page appears blank (no error handling for failed API calls)

## Existing Seeders Found

✅ **Demo data seeder**: `/backend/suitecrm/seed_demo_data.php`
- Seeds: Leads, Accounts, Contacts

✅ **Phase 2 seeder**: `/backend/suitecrm-custom/install/seed_phase2_data.php`
- Seeds: Opportunities, Cases, Calls, Meetings, Tasks
- Includes proper priorities (P1/P2/P3) for Cases

## Action Items

### 1. Start Docker Desktop First
**The Docker daemon is not running!**

```bash
# On macOS, start Docker Desktop:
# 1. Open Docker Desktop app from Applications
# 2. Wait for Docker icon in menu bar to stop animating
# 3. Verify Docker is running:
docker --version
docker ps

# Once Docker is running, then start the CRM services:
cd /Users/mitchellwhite/Code/crm
docker-compose up -d

# Verify services are running
docker ps

# Check logs if needed
docker-compose logs -f suitecrm-backend
```

### 2. Run Database Seeders
```bash
# Wait for backend to be fully ready (check docker logs)
# Then run the demo data seeder
docker exec -it suitecrm-backend php /var/www/html/suitecrm/seed_demo_data.php

# Run the Phase 2 seeder for Cases, Opportunities, and Activities
docker exec -it suitecrm-backend php /var/www/html/suitecrm-custom/install/seed_phase2_data.php
```

### 3. Fix Cases Page Error Handling
The Cases page shows blank because it doesn't handle API errors. We should add error handling to show a message when the backend is unavailable.

### 4. Verify Everything Works
After Docker is running and data is seeded:
- [ ] Login to the CRM
- [ ] Check that Leads show data
- [ ] Check that Contacts show data
- [ ] Check that Accounts show data
- [ ] Check that Opportunities show data
- [ ] Check that Cases show data (and page renders)
- [ ] Check that Activities show data
- [ ] Verify relationships work (click through from one entity to another)

## Next Steps

1. **First Priority**: Get backend server running
   - Start backend server
   - Verify it's accessible at http://localhost:8080
   
2. **Second Priority**: Fix Cases page rendering issue
   - Debug the blank page issue
   - Fix any import/routing problems
   
3. **Third Priority**: Seed the database
   - Create or run existing seeders
   - Ensure data appears in all modules
   
4. **Fourth Priority**: Verify authentication flow
   - Ensure login works properly
   - Check token is being sent with requests
   - Verify API accepts the token

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be complete when:
- [ ] Backend server runs without connection errors
- [ ] Cases page renders properly
- [ ] All modules display seeded data
- [ ] Navigation between related entities works
- [ ] No console errors in any module
