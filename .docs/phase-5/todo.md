# Phase 5: Simplification & Production Readiness

## Overview
Phase 5 focuses on simplifying the CRM to its core functionality, removing all technical debt, implementing proper authentication and APIs, and ensuring all features work correctly. This is a comprehensive cleanup and production-readiness phase.

## Core Principles
1. **SIMPLE, FUNCTIONAL** - Everything should work, no mock data, real functionality
2. **REMOVE COMPLEXITY** - Delete features and code not aligned with core functionality
3. **CONSISTENT APIS** - All APIs should follow the same patterns and standards
4. **TEST EVERYTHING** - Each feature must be tested before marking complete
5. **NO TECHNICAL DEBT** - Remove all backup files, old code, and temporary solutions
