   - AIController.php (AI lead scoring & chatbot)
   - FormBuilderController.php (form CRUD & submissions)
   - KnowledgeBaseController.php (articles & semantic search)
   - ActivityTrackingController.php (visitor tracking)
   - CustomerHealthController.php (health scoring)
2. **Database Tables**: 14 new tables successfully installed
3. **API Endpoints**: 30+ new endpoints configured and working
4. **Demo Data**: Forms, KB articles, chat conversations, activity tracking
5. **Embed Scripts**: forms-embed.js, tracking.js, chat-widget.js
6. **Services**: OpenAIService.php, CustomerHealthService.php
7. **Configuration**: AI config, .env setup, custom routing

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture Choices:
1. **OpenAI Integration**: Using GPT-4 Turbo (no org ID required) with official PHP client
2. **Caching**: Redis for embedding cache (24hr TTL) and session storage
3. **Security**: JWT auth for protected endpoints, public endpoints for forms/tracking
4. **Database**: 11 custom tables with proper indexes and relationships

### Performance Considerations:
1. **Batch Processing**: Lead scoring in batches to optimize API calls
2. **Caching Strategy**: Cache embeddings for 24 hours
3. **Database Indexes**: Add indexes on frequently queried fields
4. **Async Operations**: Background jobs for heavy computations

### Integration Points:
1. **Frontend**: RESTful API following SuiteCRM v8 standards
2. **Webhooks**: For real-time updates to external systems
3. **Embed Scripts**: Standalone JavaScript with minimal dependencies
4. **CORS**: Configured for known frontend domains

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks:
1. **OpenAI API Limits**: Implement retry logic and queuing
2. **Data Privacy**: Ensure PII is not sent to OpenAI
3. **Performance**: Monitor response times and optimize queries
4. **Security**: Regular security audits of new endpoints

### Contingency Plans:
1. **API Failures**: Fallback to manual scoring if AI unavailable
2. **High Load**: Implement caching and rate limiting
3. **Data Loss**: Regular backups of custom tables

## Notes and Observations

### Key Findings:
1. SuiteCRM v8 API is well-structured for extensions
2. Existing Redis setup can be leveraged for caching
3. Custom module framework supports our requirements
4. Frontend is already configured for API integration

### Technical Debt:
1. Consider migrating to SuiteCRM 8.x in future
2. Standardize error handling across controllers
3. Implement comprehensive logging strategy

### Documentation Needs:
1. API documentation for new endpoints
2. Integration guide for embed scripts
3. Configuration guide for AI features
4. Troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Timeline

### Day 1 (Today):
- Morning: Environment setup and dependencies
- Afternoon: Database schema and OpenAI service
- Evening: Begin AI lead scoring implementation

### Testing Checkpoints:
1. After each major component completion
2. Integration testing with frontend team
3. Final comprehensive testing before deployment
