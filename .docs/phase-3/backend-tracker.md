   - FormBuilderController.php (form CRUD & submissions)
   - KnowledgeBaseController.php (articles & semantic search)
   - ActivityTrackingController.php (visitor tracking)
   - CustomerHealthController.php (health scoring)
2. **Database Tables**: 14 new tables successfully installed
3. **API Endpoints**: 30+ new endpoints configured and working
4. **Demo Data**: Forms, KB articles, chat conversations, activity tracking
5. **Embed Scripts**: forms-embed.js, tracking.js, chat-widget.js
6. **Services**: OpenAIService.php, CustomerHealthService.php
7. **Configuration**: AI config, .env setup, custom routing
8. **Backend Structure**: Clean separation of custom vs core

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture Choices:
1. **OpenAI Integration**: Using GPT-4 Turbo (no org ID required) with official PHP client
2. **Caching**: Redis for embedding cache (24hr TTL) and session storage
3. **Security**: JWT auth for protected endpoints, public endpoints for forms/tracking
4. **Database**: 14 custom tables with proper indexes and relationships
5. **Backend Organization**: Separated /backend/custom from /backend/suitecrm for clean upgrades

### Performance Considerations:
1. **Event-Driven**: Lead scoring triggers on events (80/20 approach per user request)
2. **Caching Strategy**: Cache embeddings for 24 hours
3. **Database Indexes**: Add indexes on frequently queried fields
4. **Async Operations**: Background jobs for heavy computations

### Integration Points:
1. **Frontend**: RESTful API following SuiteCRM v8 standards
2. **Webhooks**: For real-time updates to external systems
3. **Embed Scripts**: Standalone JavaScript with minimal dependencies
4. **CORS**: Configured for known frontend domains

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks:
1. **OpenAI API Limits**: Implement retry logic and queuing
2. **Data Privacy**: Ensure PII is not sent to OpenAI
3. **Performance**: Monitor response times and optimize queries
4. **Security**: Regular security audits of new endpoints

### Contingency Plans:
1. **API Failures**: Fallback to manual scoring if AI unavailable
2. **High Load**: Implement caching and rate limiting
3. **Data Loss**: Regular backups of custom tables

## Notes and Observations

### Key Findings:
1. SuiteCRM v8 API is well-structured for extensions
2. Existing Redis setup can be leveraged for caching
3. Custom module framework supports our requirements
4. Frontend is already configured for API integration
5. Backend reorganization improved maintainability

### Technical Debt:
1. Consider migrating to SuiteCRM 8.x in future
2. Standardize error handling across controllers
3. Implement comprehensive logging strategy

### Documentation Needs:
1. API documentation for new endpoints
2. Integration guide for embed scripts
3. Configuration guide for AI features
4. Troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Implementation Fixes Applied

### Key Issues Resolved:
1. **Controller Constructor Issue**: BaseController has no constructor, removed parent::__construct() calls
2. **Database Methods**: Adapted to use SuiteCRM's DB methods instead of PDO
3. **API Routing**: Fixed .htaccess to properly route /custom/api requests
4. **Request/Response Objects**: Adapted to custom API framework methods
5. **Configuration Paths**: Fixed hardcoded paths for Docker environment
6. **Authentication**: Configured for optional auth (public endpoints working)
7. **Backend Structure**: Reorganized for clean separation of custom vs core
