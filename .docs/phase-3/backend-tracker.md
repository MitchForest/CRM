## Progress Tracking

### Current Status: Planning Phase
- **Started**: [Current Date]
- **Target Completion**: Phase 3 Backend by EOD
- **Blocker**: None currently

### Completed Tasks:
1. ‚úÖ Deep dive into existing codebase
2. ‚úÖ Review phase 3 requirements
3. ‚úÖ Create implementation plan
4. ‚úÖ Environment setup and dependencies
5. ‚úÖ Database schema creation
6. ‚úÖ OpenAI Service implementation
7. ‚úÖ AI Lead Scoring functionality

2. ‚úÖ Database schema for all Phase 3 features
3. ‚úÖ OpenAI Service with GPT-4 Turbo
4. ‚úÖ All API Controllers (AI, Forms, KB, Tracking)
5. ‚úÖ API routes configuration
6. ‚úÖ Phase 3 seed data script

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture Choices:
1. **OpenAI Integration**: Using official OpenAI PHP client for reliability
2. **Caching**: Redis for embedding cache and session storage
3. **Queue System**: Using SuiteCRM's job queue for async operations
4. **Security**: JWT tokens for API auth, rate limiting for public endpoints

### Performance Considerations:
1. **Batch Processing**: Lead scoring in batches to optimize API calls
2. **Caching Strategy**: Cache embeddings for 24 hours
3. **Database Indexes**: Add indexes on frequently queried fields
4. **Async Operations**: Background jobs for heavy computations

### Integration Points:
1. **Frontend**: RESTful API following SuiteCRM v8 standards
2. **Webhooks**: For real-time updates to external systems
3. **Embed Scripts**: Standalone JavaScript with minimal dependencies
4. **CORS**: Configured for known frontend domains

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks:
1. **OpenAI API Limits**: Implement retry logic and queuing
2. **Data Privacy**: Ensure PII is not sent to OpenAI
3. **Performance**: Monitor response times and optimize queries
4. **Security**: Regular security audits of new endpoints

### Contingency Plans:
1. **API Failures**: Fallback to manual scoring if AI unavailable
2. **High Load**: Implement caching and rate limiting
3. **Data Loss**: Regular backups of custom tables

## Notes and Observations

### Key Findings:
1. SuiteCRM v8 API is well-structured for extensions
2. Existing Redis setup can be leveraged for caching
3. Custom module framework supports our requirements
4. Frontend is already configured for API integration

### Technical Debt:
1. Consider migrating to SuiteCRM 8.x in future
2. Standardize error handling across controllers
3. Implement comprehensive logging strategy

### Documentation Needs:
1. API documentation for new endpoints
2. Integration guide for embed scripts
3. Configuration guide for AI features
4. Troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Timeline

### Day 1 (Today):
- Morning: Environment setup and dependencies
- Afternoon: Database schema and OpenAI service
- Evening: Begin AI lead scoring implementation

### Testing Checkpoints:
1. After each major component completion
2. Integration testing with frontend team
3. Final comprehensive testing before deployment
